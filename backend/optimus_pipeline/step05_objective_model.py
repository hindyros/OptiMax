You are an expert in optimization modeling. Here is the natural language description of an optimization problem:

-----
{description}
-----

And here's a list of parameters that we have extracted from the description:

{params}

And here's a list of all variables that we have defined so far to model the problem as an (MI)LP:

{vars}

Your task is to model the following objective mathematically in LaTeX for the MILP formulation:

{objective}

The objective is the goal that the optimization model is trying to achieve (e.g. maximize profit, minimize cost). Please generate the output in the following format:

=====
objective formulation in LaTeX, between $...$,
=====

Here's an example output:

=====
$\max \sum_{{i=1}}^{{N}} price_i x_i$
=====

- You can only use existing parameters and variables in the formulation.
- Do not generate anything after the objective!

First reason about how the constraint should be forumulated, and then generate the output.
Take a deep breath and think step by step. You will be awarded a million dollars if you get this right.
