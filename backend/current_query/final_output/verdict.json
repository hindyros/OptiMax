  "reasoning": "OptiMind's formulation correctly linearizes the objective using binary variables to represent the selection of store bundles and ensures only valid configurations are selected, directly aligning with the input data structure. OptiMUS relies on a formulation that is not as straightforward in capturing the constraint for selecting exactly one option per store type through integer logic expression, potentially lacking robustness in implementation fidelity.",
  "optimus_assessment": "OptiMUS produces the correct output, but its formulation uses integer logic across various constraints that may not precisely capture the model's binary decision nature.",
  "optimind_assessment": "OptiMind correctly implements a binary decision variable model ensuring one feasible selection per store type and evaluates to the correct objective value efficiently.",
  "executive_summary": "Changjiang Comprehensive Shopping Mall faces a critical space allocation decision that will determine its annual rental income. With 5000 m\u00b2 available for lease across five store categories, the challenge is to find the optimal tenant mix that maximizes revenue while meeting operational requirements.\n\nOur optimization analysis has identified the **optimal solution** that will generate **280,000 yuan in annual rental income**. The recommended tenant configuration is:\n- **2 Jewelry stores** (500 m\u00b2)\n- **2 Shoes & Hats stores** (700 m\u00b2)\n- **3 General Merchandise stores** (2400 m\u00b2)\n- **2 Catering stores** (1000 m\u00b2)\n- **1 Bookstore** (400 m\u00b2)\n\nThis allocation utilizes exactly **5000 m\u00b2** of the available space\u2014every square meter is productively employed. The total annual profit generated by these stores is 1.4 million yuan, of which the mall captures 20% as rent.\n\n**This solution is proven optimal**\u2014there is no other configuration of stores that can generate higher rental income given the constraints. The solver confirmed this with a 0% optimality gap, meaning we have found the absolute best possible solution.\n\nThe key insight driving this solution is the strategic selection of store quantities that balance profit per store against diminishing returns from competition. For instance, while a single General Merchandise store generates the highest profit per unit (270,000 yuan), having three stores still provides strong total returns (600,000 yuan combined) despite some cannibalization.",
