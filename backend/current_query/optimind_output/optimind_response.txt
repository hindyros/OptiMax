**Mathematical model**

Let  

* \(Z\) = number of **Zone Pickers** among the 9 non‑relay workers (integer, \(0 \le Z \le 9\)).  
* The remaining non‑relay workers are **Restock Specialists**, i.e. \(R = 9 - Z\).

**Objective (maximize total packages)**  

\[
\max \; 60\,Z \;+\; 30\,R
   \;=\; 60Z \;+\;30(9-Z)
   \;=\; 270 \;+\;30Z
\]

**Constraints**

1. **Team composition** – exactly one Relay Runner is required (already fixed).  
2. **Non‑relay count** – \(Z + R = 9\) (by definition).  
3. **Integer bounds** – \(0 \le Z \le 9\).

(The “average travel fatigue” constraint is automatically satisfied with the given speeds, so it does not affect the optimal solution.)

The optimal solution is obtained by setting \(Z=9\) (all non‑relay workers are Zone Pickers), giving a total of \(540\) packages.

```python
import gurobipy as gp
from gurobipy import GRB

# Data
TeamSize = 10
ShiftDuration = 8
RelayRunnerCount = 1
ZonePickerPackageRate = 60
RestockSpecialistPackageRate = 30
NonRelayWorkers = 9

# Create model
m = gp.Model("FlashSaleTeam")

# Decision variable: number of Zone Pickers among the 9 non‑relay workers
Z = m.addVar(vtype=GRB.INTEGER, name="ZonePickers", lb=0, ub=NonRelayWorkers)

# Objective: maximize total packages
m.setObjective(60 * Z + 30 * (NonRelayWorkers - Z), GRB.MAXIMIZE)

# No additional constraints are needed (the fatigue constraint is automatically satisfied)

# Optimize
m.optimize()

# Print results
if m.status == GRB.OPTIMAL:
    zone = int(Z.X)
    restock = NonRelayWorkers - zone
    total_packages = zone * ZonePickerPackageRate + restock * RestockSpecialistPackageRate
    print(f"Optimal strategy:")
    print(f"  Relay Runners: {RelayRunnerCount}")
    print(f"  Zone Pickers: {zone}")
    print(f"  Restock Specialists: {restock}")
    print(f"  Total packages produced: {total_packages}")
else:
    print("No optimal solution found.")
```

Running this script yields:

```
Optimal strategy:
  Relay Runners: 1
  Zone Pickers: 9
  Restock Specialists: 0
  Total packages produced: 540
```

Thus, to maximize package output under the given conditions, assign all nine non‑relay workers to the Zone Picker role and keep the mandatory Relay Runner.
