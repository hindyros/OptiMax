    "description": "We have a 10-person team for an 8-hour flash sale shift where we must maximize total package output while keeping the team's average travel fatigue under 10 miles per day. One worker must be the mandatory Relay Runner (4.0 mph, 0 packages/hr), and the remaining 9 must be split between Zone Pickers (2.5 mph, 60 packages/hr) and Restock Specialists (1.5 mph, 30 packages/hr). Find me the optimal strategy to get the maximum output package output.",
